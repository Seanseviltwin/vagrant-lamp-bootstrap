Put `Vagrantfile` and `bootstrap.sh` inside a folder and do a `vagrant up` on the command line.
This box uses Ubuntu 14.04 LTS "Trustry Thar" 64bit, so if you don't have the basic box already, do a 
`vagrant box add ubuntu/trusty64` before.

drupal u/p is drupal/12345678 (even if you change the password variable for other files) if you wish to change it, you have to clear the database.
